At the ZhouYang lab, we seek to understand how information is represented and processed in the mammalian brain to support flexible perception and behavior. To learn more, please check out our [research directions](https://www.baidu.com) and [publications](https://www.baidu.com).

# Reserch Interest 
1. Neural Circuits and Mechanisms: Investigate the neural circuits and computational principles underlying advanced cognitive functions such as abstract concept representation, learning, and flexible decision-making in humans and primates.
2. Abstract Concept Representation：Uncover how abstract concepts (e.g., numbers, rules, intentions) are encoded in the brain and their dynamic neural mechanisms.
3. Flexible Decision-Making: Elucidate the neural computational models and regulatory mechanisms of flexible decisions (e.g., adapting to environmental changes, strategy switching).
4. Disease Treatment and Applications：Develop interventions for cognitive disorders (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease, schizophrenia) and advance neuromorphic AI by leveraging neural circuit mechanisms.
5. Brain-Inspired AI Algorithm: Develop new AI algorithm form the reference of the brain circuit and brain mechanism

# Join us

Our interdisciplinary lab seeks **self-driven, curious students** passionate about merging **neuroscience, neural engineering, and artificial intelligence** to advance fundamental discovery and real-world innovation. We investigate how the brain represents abstract concepts, learns flexibly, and makes decisions—research that directly informs the development of brain-inspired AI systems and therapies for cognitive disorders. While our primary focus is on awake primate neuroscience using techniques like multi-brain-region electrophysiology, optogenetics, and two-photon imaging, **we actively seek collaborators from diverse backgrounds, including computer science, electrical engineering, and beyond**.

Students will engage in cutting-edge projects spanning neural circuit analysis, AI-driven data modeling, and neuroengineering tool development. Whether you’re designing algorithms to decode neural activity, engineering hardware for brain-machine interfaces, or integrating machine learning with experimental neuroscience, your work will contribute to breakthroughs in AI ethics, disease treatment, and next-generation computing.


Interested candidates should submit a CV, a brief research statement outlining their interests and goals, and examples of technical work (e.g., code, projects) to **Yangzhou1@pku.edu.cn** with the subject “ZhouyangLab Application.” Join us to shape the future of brain-inspired technology!
